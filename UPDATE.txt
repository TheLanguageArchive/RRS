INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPGRADING THE RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM

Below are instructions for upgrading from one version of RRS to another. The
history is kept with the more recent versions coming first. Each section has a
header indicating from which version or range of versions to which newer version
the required changes apply.

From version 1.5 on it is possible to review the exact version and revision
number of a deployed RRS instance by browsing to the webapp's deploy
location (e.g. /ds/RRS_V1). This information can also be found without deploying 
by inspecting the contents of the file index.jsp inside the WAR file from the
deployment package.

= READ THIS FIRST: General update instructions =

RRS provides several versions of the web.xml file. They can be found in the
WEB-INF directory of the extracted WAR, which will initially contain no web.xml
file. To make the application work, you will have to choose one of the web-*.xml
files and rename or copy it to web.xml OR keep/copy the web.xml file of a 
previous installation, in which case you should apply all changes made to the
template file since the previously installed version to this file as well.

In the case of a Shibboleth environment, you should also copy your existing
shhaa.xml file to the new WEB-INF and apply all changes that have been made
to the example file (shhaa-example.xml) to it.

= Upgrading from 1.4.x or lower to 1.5.x r35953 or higher =

- Most configuration options have changed. See INSTALL.txt for details on how to
configure web.xml and (in the case of a shibboleth environment) shhaa.xml in the
WEB-INF directory.

- A large number of context parameters has been added. See INSTALL.TXT for an
overview. The following parameters were available either in web.xml or as
context parameters in previous versions and should be mapped to the
corresponding new parameters:

EMAIL_HOST -> nl.mpi.smtpHost 
EMAIL_ADDRESS_CORPMAN -> nl.mpi.emailAddressCorpman 
AMS_INTERFACE_LINK -> nl.mpi.rrs.amsInterfaceLink
REGISTRATION_FILENAME -> nl.mpi.rrs.registrationFile 
DOBES_COC_LINK -> nl.mpi.rrs.dobesCocLink (semantics have changed!) 
DOBES_COC_LICENSE_NAME -> nl.mpi.rrs.dobesCocLicenseName
ARCHIVE_USERS_IDP_NAME -> nl.mpi.rrs.archiveUsersIdpName
OPENPATH_PREFIX -> nl.mpi.imdibrowserOpenPathPrefix

Please compare your configuration to the parameters mentioned in INSTALL.txt to
see which parameters are missing!!

- Remove any database connection information from the application specific
configuration files if present. RRS now uses named database connections. The
names of these are set in web.xml but should match the default names (AMS2DB and
CSDB).

- Be aware that RRS 1.5 depends on AMS2 version 1.4.9.1. It supplies the package
but depends on a compatible database structure.

= Upgrading from 1.6.0b or lower to 1.6.1 or higher =

The following OPTIONAL context parameters 

- nl.mpi.rrs.checkEmailSubject
    (Defaults to "Max Planck Institute registration check")

- nl.mpi.rrs.confirmationEmailSubject
    (Defaults to "Max Planck Institute registration")

= Upgrading from 1.5.x r33877 or lower to 1.5.x r35953 or higher =

The context parameter nl.mpi.rrs.openPathPrefix has been replaced by
nl.mpi.imdibrowserOpenPathPrefix
