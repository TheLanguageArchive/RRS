                        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
                        <h3><em>DOBES-CoC-V2
                                </em></h3>

                        Peter Wittenburg, 19.7.2005</h3>
                </div>
                <h3>General Statements</h3>
                <p>The Code of Conduct determines ethical guidelines for all participants in the DOBES
                        documentation program and the users of the resulting resources. Fieldworkers,
                        archivists, users, and funding agencies have to accept this CoC as the basic guideline
                        for their activities. Any violation of these guidelines will be taken seriously and may
                        have the consequence of loss of permission to contribute to the program or to use the
                        data.</p>
                <p>
                        As indicated in the figure different parties are involved in DOBES program with
                        different roles:</p>
                <p></p>

                <img src="dobes_legal_situation.gif" alt="" border="0"/>
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>The acting teams in DOBES (indicated by a light yellow color) are embedded in
                        organizational structures all defining legal frameworks of a different nature. To define
                        a common basis for all persons and organizations involved in DOBES a Code of
                        Conduct was defined and all are bound to adhere to its rules. Also all users of the
                        DOBES material will have to accept the Code of Conduct as their basis.</p>
                <p>A Linguistic Advisory Board will give advice to the archivist to carry out his task in
                        accordance with the international efforts in documenting endangered languages. This
                        Linguistic Advisory Board will be asked for advice in matters where conflicts about
                        ethical behavior occur. To achieve this, internationally respected members of the
                        linguistic field researcher community will be members of this board.</p>
                <h3>Ethical Rules</h3>
                <li>Everyone will respect the Intellectual and Cultural Property Rights of the
                        individual consultants and their communities. Wishes with respect to
                        protecting the privacy of individuals will be respected.</li>
                <li>No one is allowed to offend the religious feelings of the consultants or
                        communities. No missionary or political activities are allowed to be carried
                        out under the umbrella of the DOBES documentation task.</li>
                        <li>No one is allowed to use the recorded and analyzed data for commercial
                        purposes without permission from the speech community.
                        a. It is the speech community that deals with the issue of commercial uses.
                        The speech community not only gives permission, but also decides all
                        aspects involved in the commercial use (copyrights, sharing profits, etc).
                        b. If the speech community does allow a user to make commercial uses, then
                        the user should present a contract agreed with the speech community. This
                        contract should be officially recognized by the required authorities
                        (including authorities in the country where the speech community lives).
                        This is to ensure that the whole process is made in a legal and transparent
                        way.</li>
                        <li>All parties must respect the national laws and the rules of the authorized
                        organizations in the different countries.</li>
                        <li>All parties will support the general frameworks as defined by the UN,
                        UNESCO and WIPO where they are applicable.</li>
                        <li>The consultants and communities will be informed openly and seriously about
                        the goals of the DOBES program and about the possibilities of misuse.</li>
                        <li>In general fieldworkers will document the agreed mutual understanding about
                        the nature of the research and the formal consent achieved with the consultants
                        by means of a signed document<sup>1</sup>.</li>
                        <li>The parties will support efforts for revitalizing the languages within the limits
                        of their possibilities.</li>
                        <li>Fieldworkers should operate in such a way as to ensure future fieldwork and
                        the reputation of their field.</li>
                        <li>The parties understand their participation as part of the great challenge to
                        preserve cultural heritage for future generations. This includes the obligation
                        to make material as accessible for interested non-commercial users as possible.</li>
                        <li>The parties will record and archive the data according to professional
                        standards, but taking in consideration the limitations of the field work.</li>
                        <li>The archivist will take appropriate steps to ensure long lifetime of the data.
                        <li>The users of DOBES data will respect the intention of the recordings and
                        acknowledge the work that the archivist and especially the collectors have
                        invested. In general this is to be documented by making references in
                        publications and by mentioning the names of the consultants if this is wanted.</li>
                        <li>The users will give copies of all added data that will enrich the corpus to the
                        archive and make it available to other interested and serious users maximally
                        within three years after the analysis work has been started.</li>
                        <li>A transfer of DOBES data to third persons or organizations is generally
                        forbidden.</li>
